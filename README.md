Outlier Detection: Identifies and visualizes outliers in the age distribution.

Discretization: Categorizes customers into age groups (young, mid-age, mature) for segmentation.

Normalization: Applies min-max scaling and z-score normalization to the age data.

## Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, CSV)
